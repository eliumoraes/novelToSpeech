# NovelToSpeech

This repository contains a Python project designed for converting novel text to speech, primarily focusing on novels from [Novelhall](https://www.novelhall.com). The application allows users to paste the novel text into a UI, divides the text into chunks (to accommodate API character limits), generates speech from these chunks, and plays the audio.
