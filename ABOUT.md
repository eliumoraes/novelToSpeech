# About NovelToSpeech

NovelToSpeech is a bespoke Python application designed to enhance the reading experience for novel enthusiasts. This application transforms written text from novels, specifically tailored for users who frequent https://www.novelhall.com, into audible speech. It breaks down large texts into manageable chunks to comply with the API's character limits, generates speech from these chunks, and provides a seamless playback feature to listen to the text.

The inspiration behind NovelToSpeech comes from the desire to make literature more accessible and enjoyable for everyone, including those who may prefer auditory learning or have visual impairments. This tool is perfect for consuming long-form content such as novels, where the convenience of audio can significantly enhance the user's experience.

## Features

- **Text Chunking**: Splits large texts into smaller chunks.
- **Speech Generation**: Converts text chunks into speech.
- **Playback Functionality**: Allows users to listen to the generated speech directly within the application.

## Future Plans

We are constantly looking to improve NovelToSpeech. Future updates may include support for more languages, enhanced voice options, and integration with more novel websites. Your feedback and contributions are highly valued as we continue to develop this tool to meet the needs of our users.
